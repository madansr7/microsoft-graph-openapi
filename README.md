# Microsoft Graph OpenAPI v3.0.1 description

## Microsoft Graph
Microsoft Graph is made up of resources connected by relationships. For example, a user can be connected to a group through a memberOf relationship, and to another user through a manager relationship. Your app can traverse these relationships to access these connected resources and perform actions on them through the API.
You can also get valuable insights and intelligence about the data from Microsoft Graph. For example, you can get the popular files trending around a user or get the most relevant people around a user.

## OpenAPI specification
OpenAPI specification is an API description standard by the OpenAPI initiative. It allows an API to be described in a human and computer readable format. Find more information at [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) GitHub site.

## Mapping (OData -> OpenAPI mapping)
The OpenAPI representation for OData based Microsoft Graph has been done with the help of the [OpenAPI.Net.OData](https://github.com/Microsoft/OpenAPI.NET.OData) library. Based on the OASIS conventions defined for converting OData => OpenAPI, we used the openapi.net.odata lib to create the description for MS Graph. 

## Documentation and resources
Detailed documentation and other learning resources for Microsoft Graph can be found on the [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview) site.
